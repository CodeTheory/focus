  <h3 align="center">Kap</h3>
  <p align="center">An open-source screen recorder built with web technology
    This software could be used for a variety of tasks. This can used for
    teachers and educators to record a lesson or a virtual whiteboard to teach
    students lessons. This screen recorder can also be used for content purposes;
    for example, content creators and gamers can use the software to record tutorials,
    share highlights, or just for personal entertainment. I plan to implement features 
    in the future where we use it so people and content creators can use the software
    to give live footage of what they see, like games or other content like movies
    and videos.
